# webdubois: W.E.B. Du Bois Challenge plots <img align="right" src="https://github.com/IcaroBernardes/webdubois/blob/main/portrait.jpg" alt="logo" width="200">

[W.E.B. Du Bois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) (February 23, 1868 – August 27, 1963) was an American sociologist, socialist, historian
and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist (*Source: Wikpedia*). 

In the 1900 Paris Exposition his team made a historical display. They presented in many charts the situation of Black people in Georgia and the US in general.
The timelessness of these posters provoked Anthony Starks, Allen Hillery and Sekou Tyler to create the
[#DuBoisChallenge2022](https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/tree/master/challenge/2022). The proposal was to reproduce Du Bois posters with any tools
whatsoever. I chose to make these charts in `R` using `ggplot` and some of its extensions. Furthermore, like Du Bois I used this opportunity to talk about racial
inequality in my own country, Brazil.
